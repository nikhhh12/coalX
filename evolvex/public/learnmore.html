                    <h3>What is Climate Change?</h3>
                    <p>Climate Change (also known as Global Warming) is the name given to long-term changes to temperature on and around the Earth’s surface, which causes long-term shifts to weather patterns.</p>
                    <p>Climate Change isn't limited to one region; it impacts the whole of the Earth. It is causing polar ice sheets and glaciers to melt, and sea levels to rise. Extreme weather events such as typhoons and hurricanes are becoming more common in some regions of the world, while other regions experience more punishing droughts and heatwaves.</p>
                    <p>The warmer ocean surface temperatures impact corals and alter coral reef communities by prompting coral bleaching events and altering ocean chemistry. These impacts affect corals and the many organisms that use coral reefs as habitat.</p>

                <br>
                <p>In 2014, The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) published the 5th Assessment report on climate change based on long-term scientific evidence. This stated that the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations (namely carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) over the past 100 years has predominantly been caused by human activities.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>How do Greenhouse gases (GHG)s change the temperature?</h3>
                <p>GHGs are able to absorb long wave radiation (heat) that is reflected off the Earth’s surface. They are then able to reemit this radiation back down to Earth. If there were no GHGs in our atmosphere the Earth would be too cold for life as we know it to exist. However, as more fossil fuels, are burnt and other GHGs are released, the atmosphere is able to absorb more radiation and so is warming up. This is known as the greenhouse effect.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>What are Largest Sources of GHGs?</h3>
                <p>GHG emissions come from a range of human activities including electricity generation, industrial process and transportation. Currently electricity and transport represent the largest sources of emissions and greatest opportunity for saving</p>

                <br>
                <h3>What effects of climate change are being seen?</h3>
                <p>The effects of climate change are already being seen across the Earth. The IPPC reported in the 5th Assessment Report that since 1880 there has been an increase in average surface temperature of 0.85⁰C. This may seem like a small number compared to changes in daily temperature however to put it into comparison how small global temperature changes can have a large effect, if the Earth’s surface temperature was lowered by 5⁰C it would be in a full ice age.</p>
                <p>Other changes currently being seen:</p>
                <p>1. Increase in sea level (global sea level has increased by 0.19m between 1910 and 2010)
                    <br> 2. Increase in sea surface temperature (global average increase of 0.11⁰C between 1971 and 2010)
                    <br> 3. Reduction in sea ice (2016 saw the lowest winter sea ice ever recorded, beating the 2015 record)
                    <br> 4. Change in precipitation (Some areas of the Earth are becoming seeing more intense flooding while others are seeing severe droughts)
                    <br> 5. Change in El Nino intensity (As El Nino intensity is in part based on sea surface temperatures, rising temperatures will cause more intense El Ninos causing flooding, droughts, wild fires and famines.
                    <br> 6. Ocean Acidification (The acidity of the oceans has decreased by 0.1 on the pH scale since the beginning of the industrial era).
                </p>
                <p>As the global temperature continues to increase, so will the severity of these changes.</p>
                <p>2021 saw the US hit by 20 separate billion-dollar climate disasters (NOAA, 2022) (causing a total of $145billion in damage), killing 648 people. This shows that the threat of climate change is very real, relevant and cannot be ignored.</p>

Just the no cost and low cost recommendations alone will cut energy costs by over 5% with a payback from cost savings in 1 year. I would strongly recommend Carbon Footprint to other companies looking to take their carbon management to the next level.”
